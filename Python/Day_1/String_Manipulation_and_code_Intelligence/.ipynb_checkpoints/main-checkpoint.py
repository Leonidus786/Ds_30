# print("Hello World!")
# print("Hello World!")
# print("Hello World!")

# Instead of writing this 3 times we can use "\n" which is a new line character for doing the same
# thing in a single line of code

# print("Hello World!\nHello World!\nHello World!")


# String --> Set of characters is called strings.
# Amit = 2
# print(type(Amit))
# name = str('Amit')   #using str method
# print(type(name))


# print("Hello" + "Abhishek")  # There should be a space in between two words.

#This would do the same with a space between two words.
# print("Hello " + "Abhishek") #Space in hello
# print("Hello" + " Abhishek") # Space before name
# print("Hello" + " " +"Abhishek") # Space in between two words

# Spaces in python are quite important 
    # print("Hello World") #this would give a error


# input() will get user input in console
# Then print() will print the word "Hello" and the user input
# print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))


# print("hello " +input("what is your mail id? "))
