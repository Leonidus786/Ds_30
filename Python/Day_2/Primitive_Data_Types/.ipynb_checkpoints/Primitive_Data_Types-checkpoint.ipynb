    "# Strings - This is just a set of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# \"Hello\" #This word Hello is comprised of these five characters strung together.\n",
    "\n",
    "# And we always know that strings, when we create them, We have to create them with double/single quotes around.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now because this is a string of characters, we can actually pull out each character individually.\n",
    "# So we could , for example instead of just writing hello, we can add some square brackets.\n",
    "# And inside the square brackets, we can put the index or the position of the character that we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example if I wanted to have the first character out of this word hello, I would put zero right here.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hello\"[0])\n",
    "\n",
    "# It's really important to remember that programmers always start counting from zero.\n",
    "# because we work with binary -- zeroes and ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "# This method of pulling out a particular element from a string is called subscripting.\n",
    "# And the numbers in between the square brackets determines which character you are going to pull out.\n",
    "# So by using these square brackets and putting a number inside, we're able to dissect\n",
    "# our string and pull out individual characters as and when we need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"123\" + \"345\")\n",
    "# this just concatenated these two strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "# As long as these numbers are kept inside these double quotes, then this is \n",
    "# not treated as a number by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Integer -- this is programming lingo for just whole numbers, numbers without any decimal places.\n",
    "print(123+345)\n",
    "\n",
    "# just as we have some useful things we can do with strings.\n",
    "# There's some really handy things we can do with integers.\n",
    "# Commonly when we write large numbers, at least in the UK or in the US, we'd like\n",
    "# to put commas in between the thousands.\n",
    "# ex. 342,654,896\n",
    "\n",
    "# In python we can replace these commas simply with underscore and it will be\n",
    "# interpreted by the computer as if you had written this.\n",
    "# So the computer actually removes those underscores and ignores it.\n",
    "# The benefit is just for us humans to be able to visualize it more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(342_654_896)\n",
    "\n",
    "# So I mentioned that all whole numbers no matter if they're positive or negative,\n",
    "# are called integers in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "# So what do you call it when you actually have decimal places?\n",
    "# well, they are called a float and this is short for a floating-point number.\n",
    "# So, for example, if you had, the numbers of PI, you have 3.14159 and this,\n",
    "# because it has a decimal place, is now a float data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(3.14159)\n",
    "\n",
    "# So if you think of the decimal point as being able to float around the number\n",
    "# because it could occur at any point, then you've got yourself a floating point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boolean \n",
    "\n",
    "# Now the final data type is something called a boolean.\n",
    "# and this is very simple. It only has two possible values, True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(True)\n",
    "print(False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now note how these values begin with a capital T or capital F and they don't have\n",
    "# any quotation marks around them or anything.\n",
    "# So this is actaully a data type which is going to be used a lot in your programs\n",
    "# to test if something is true, if something is false and for your program to respond accordingly.\n",
