# BMI 1.0
# In this exercise, we're going to be writing a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index from a user's weight and height.
# So if you look below in this file, you'll see a link to the Wikipedia page for BMI.
# And if you click on that, you can learn a little bit more about what the Body mass index is and how it's used.
# But essentially, it's a way for us to measure someone's weight taking into account their height.
# So for example, if a tall person, and a short person both weighed the same, then in most cases, the shorter person is more overweight.
# The formula for calculating BMI is dividing the person's weight, in kilograms, by the square of their height, in meters.
# This is height multiplied by height, and then taking that value, and dividing the weight by that value.
# Now, if you're not familiar with mathematical notation for how the BMI is calculated in the formula
# in the pdf file, then feel free to look up in Google for alternative ways of representing this formula.
# But it's very important that the inputs are in the correct units.
# So in this case, it's metric units, kilograms and meters.
# And the goal is to be able to print out the BMI using any potential inputs, where the first input is the height
# and the second input is the weight, in meters and in kilograms. 
# Now, one thing to note is that in our tests for this exercise, we're expecting the BMI to be printed out as a whole number.
# So think about what you need to do in order to make that happen.
# You can always Google for a Body Mass Index Calculator and check your result against their result to figure out if you went wrong anywhere
# or if you need to change your code.
# So good luck, and give that a go.
