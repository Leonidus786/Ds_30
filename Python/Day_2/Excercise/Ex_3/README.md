# In this exercise, we're going to write a program that recreates something that I saw in a blog.

# I recently read this book called "Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks " and it shocked me a little bit that we only have 4,000 weeks in our lifetime.
# And 4,000 is a number that we can all count to.
# It's a large number, but it's still relatively easy to understand.
# And there's this great blog post by Tim Urban called "Your Life in Weeks," 
# and if you look in the above, you'll see a link to this blog post.
# You can see as he visualizes your 90 year human life in months and in weeks.
# And when it's all there on paper, and you can see each individual little box,
# it kind of shocks you just how little time we have on Earth.
# And if you really drill down into it and think about, well, how many summers do you have and how many Christmases do you get to spend, then it all gets a little bit existential. So, that is the goal.
# Today we're going to get existential and we're going to use programming and our skills that we've learned in order to calculate the number of weeks that we have left in our lifetime.
# The goal is to take the input as your age.
# So for example, here I've got somebody aged 15, and we're presuming that they're going to live until 90, we're going to be optimistic.
# And then we're going to calculate how many weeks they have left in their lifetime.
# And we're going to output this as a string with the exact format that you see in the pdf which is "You have X weeks left."
# where X is replaced with the actual number of weeks that you have calculated.
